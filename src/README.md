# Acta Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the Acta application.

## Directory Structure

- `/components` - React components organized by type and feature
- `/hooks` - React hooks for different domains
- `/store` - State management
- `/utils` - Utility functions
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/constants` - Application constants

## Code Organization Rules

1. Use alias imports (`@/`) instead of relative paths
2. Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
3. Organize code by feature when possible
4. Use barrel files (index.ts) for exports
